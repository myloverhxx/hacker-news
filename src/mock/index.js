Chargebacks. A real pain in the ass. I shared a post on IH about it. Basically there is no way for us to issue someone a refund if they are doing a chargeback.

PayPal does it - basically, if the customer submits dispute, PayPal first tries to contact the seller to voluntarily provide the refund and only if they refuse, the dispute is being reviewed. Why Stripe cannot work this way? That would save a lot of drama and stress involved running the business for both sides - you and us, your customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. Pricing info.

But over time, even the better payment services started breaking APIs and neglecting documentation and dropping customer service standards and increasing prices, and maintaining those integrations became painful. Governments started changing their regulations and tax rules, and updating our systems to keep up with the ever-changing compliance and tax obligations become painful too. We also found that fraud and chargebacks weren\u0026#x27;t a significant problem for us, but surprisingly, churn due to unreliable card charges was unbelievably bad and could turn an otherwise healthy growth rate negative all on its own, which was not a good combination with the aforementioned drop in standards at the payment services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we\u0026#x27;re now looking for, in a nutshell, is a service to which we can outsource payment processing, subscription management, and all of the sales tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations. I don\u0026#x27;t want to use APIs or webhooks any more than I absolutely have to. I want to fill in correct, context-aware, all-inclusive prices on our pricing page with ideally one line of code. I want to hand our customers off smoothly to a well-designed, batteries-included sign-up flow with ideally one line of code.

It is not only for the self-centered reason that it would affect my business – it is because it contributes to the consolidation of ecommerce to only a few select companies. It adds friction to consumer transactions with small businesses, causing  consumers to become aggravated with these small businesses. It conditions consumers to believe it is easier to deal with large businesses that always seem to have a \u0026quot;cancel\u0026quot; button and easy-order-cancellation policies, opposed to the small businesses that just seem to make things hard and expensive for no good reason. This will contribute to the consolidation of ecommerce to a small number of multi-billion dollar players like Walmart, eBay, Amazon, etc. Allow me to explain:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf someone makes a purchase of a $1500 ultrasonic cleaner from me, and then realizes they made a mistake, I now have to tell them there’s a $43.50 restocking fee, even if they call me 2 minutes after they place the order. This will leave a disgusting taste in the customer’s mouth, but I have to do it, because I can’t expose myself to a $43.50 fee for something I have zero control over. That customer may eventually notice that Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc, do not charge such a fee. The customer has no idea why – they just know dealing with Amazon means less friction. The customer will now utilize Amazon more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany will say that this is a dumb gripe. “If you don’t like it go somewhere else!” PayPal instituted this policy as well. They backed down temporarily after people made a stink about it, but months later continued forward with the policy. I currently use a merchant services provider that does not implement these fees, but for how long?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy time in my industry has taught me that companies will often wait for one “outlier” to make controversial reforms to their platform\u0026#x2F;products before doing it themselves. Whether it is gluing the battery inside of a cellphone, or adding strange fees to transactions. Once a profitable, anti-consumer move succeeds with the company not going out of business, it emboldens other firms to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy merchant services provider doesn’t charge this fee. Yet. But they saw Stripe charge it, and get away with it. They saw PayPal charge it and have another more profitable quarter. The outrage lasted a week, the increased profit lasted forever. “Gee, it isn’t a business killer after all. Maybe we should do it too!” will come up in corporate boardrooms across America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, we’re left with a landscape where the only companies left in ecommerce who can offer customers friction-free order cancellations are Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. Who wants that? Yes, people can say “just absorb the fee if you don’t want your customers to be mad at you.” How? I am already competing as a dude with no outside financing with a trillion dollar company – I’m winning if I am making any sales at all! Now I’m expected to compete on price when I have to absorb fees when customers cancel an order?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s say you manage to claw your way into a market by offering a better product, or after sales service on that product to the point where you can compete with Amazon. That is a miracle in and of itself. To then have to deal with a minefield of additional charges that your competitor doesn’t have to is just another nail in the coffin of small-business ecommerce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI find it awful, and I protest using these services.

Out of many many thousands of transactions, I\u0026#x27;ve only had about 3 or 4 transactions get flagged as high risk by PayPal.

Stripe sends out an email letting you know, but then it\u0026#x27;s now on you to decide if you want to contest the dispute. This dispute typically happens when someone who got their credit card stolen sees an unknown charge in their records.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow you need to fill out like 8 form fields and supply screenshots and server logs of proof that someone was accessing the material they\u0026#x27;ve stolen (I sell digital courses so there\u0026#x27;s no physical item). The screenshots need to be sized perfectly to be displayed in portrait mode on a sheet of paper that gets faxed over to the person reviewing it from the bank, otherwise it\u0026#x27;ll be unreadable from their perspective and you\u0026#x27;ll auto-lose the case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStripe doesn\u0026#x27;t let you see a real preview of these screenshots and they even alter the uploaded image size in your preview which makes it hard to preview what it will look like from the reviewer\u0026#x27;s POV even though that\u0026#x27;s the only thing that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter doing that, it takes about 2-3 months to get a resolution. You get charged a $15 bank dispute fee (on top of the full amount of the product of course) which is non-refundable unless you happen to win the dispute, but if someone got their card stolen then you\u0026#x27;re not going to win the case. You also don\u0026#x27;t get any information from Stripe about the review, other than you won or lost. Stripe says it\u0026#x27;s because banks don\u0026#x27;t give them any info beyond that.

I said Wordpress said they logged in once when they bought it and never again (of course, anyone could say that). I said their account email matched their Stripe email which had their name in it, and their IP matches where the billing address is so it seems to be a real person. I also said they\u0026#x27;d never responded to any emails sent to them from us to resolve this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite being nearly certain this was just a change-of-mind chargeback I didn\u0026#x27;t have high hopes because that\u0026#x27;s a lot of conjecture rather than evidence but it worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also had an early fraud warning giving us notice to refund and avoid the chargeback fee. I chose not to because it looked legitimate to me which was probably a mistake despite how it worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also use Paypal. My major issue is their internal dev team\u0026#x2F;processes seem broken. We got stuck in a \u0026#x27;verify your identity\u0026#x27; loop for months. The business support person was great, patient and understanding. But no one could fix it. We\u0026#x27;d pass the check then overnight it would revert and block transactions, sometimes multiple times a day. We setup a second payment processor as we should\u0026#x27;ve much earlier. Eventually it was fixed without explanation or notice. Braintree is probably a lot better on this front but having the Paypal logo more prominently displayed has a lot of value for some customers who don\u0026#x27;t like the unfamiliar.\u003c/p\u003e","points":null,"parent_id":22891470,"story_id":22889778,"children":[{"id":22894559,"created_at":"2020-04-16T23:15:50.000Z","created_at_i":1587078950,"type":"comment","author":"nickjj","title":null,"url":null,"text":"\u003cp\u003eAll of what you provided as proof was what I submit too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;ve won 100% of the disputes where it was pretty clear the person wanted to just grab the content for free and then do a charge back.
